# Project: Calculator
for The Odin Project's foundations course.

## Introduction
For this project, I am creating a calculator with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The full assignment can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator).

### Create functions for add, subtract, multiply and divide, set up user variables
Set up simple maths functions. Tested them with console.log. Added a rule for the divide function so if user attempts to divide by zero, it returns an error. Created variables to store the users first number, chosen operator (add, subtract, multiply, divide), and second number.

### Create operate function and add buttons to the calculator.
Made a new function that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls the correct previous function. Created buttons for the calculator in the html. Added event listeners in JavaScript so that the display updates correctly on each press.
