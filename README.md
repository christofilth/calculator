# Project: Calculator
for The Odin Project's foundations course.

## Introduction
For this project, I am creating a calculator with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The full assignment can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator).

### Create functions for add, subtract, multiply and divide, set up user variables
Set up simple maths functions. Tested them with console.log. Added a rule for the divide function so if user attempts to divide by zero, it returns an error.
